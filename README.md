 <p>My "ex-wife" said.

"You ought to rejoice and feel a sense of relief at your separation from her. I am convinced she is burdened with deep-seated wounds that she cannot surmount, will make you sick and lonely with the thorns.

I really want you to be happy! Do not harbor such a woman in your heart! Don't waste your time thinking about someone like that. Look for someone who's genuine and kind. 

She is just a vulgar woman! Love and parting should be conducted with manners and dignity!

I believe that in matters of love and parting, even in confession and rejection, a woman lacking elegance and dignity is akin to a vulgar barmaid.
I assert that such a woman is coarse, impolite, and morally fallen. She undoubtedly revels in seduction, brimming with hubris, and harbors the belief that she can captivate any man's heart at will. She is merely a sly and lascivious individual. There exist women who, irrespective of their feelings towards you, aim to exact revenge, inflicting hurt and anguish."
